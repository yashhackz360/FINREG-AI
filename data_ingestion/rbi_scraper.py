    A stub function for a more complex financial regulatory web scraper.

    In a real-world scenario, this function would use a library like BeautifulSoup or
    Scrapy to navigate various regulator websites (RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, PFRDA, etc.),
    extract links to new documents that might not be in the RSS feeds,
    and return them as a list of URLs.

    Returns:
        A list of example URLs to simulate the output of a real web scraper.
